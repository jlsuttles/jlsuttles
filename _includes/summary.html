  I am a classically trained computer scientist & modern software developer with three years of professional experience. I've helped several venture projects become profitable products both as a developer and as a project lead. I am very versatile & enjoy learning to use new technologies. <strong>Ruby on Rails in my main squeeze.</strong>
